Close to midnight, Mona arrived home in what her guardian described as 'a confused and bewildered state'. She is currently receiving medical care for mild hypothermia. \"I don't know what's wrong with her,\" a friend - who wished to remain anonymous - informed us. \"She kept whispering, over and over again, 'I should never have left the cat...' but she doesn't even like cats!\"^The words \"I'm sorry\" are scrawled across it in red crayon.",
       "SecretCave.007": "(Pages torn from a notebook): ^The curse was meant for me. I know it! Triss saved my life AND that of our baby. If it had hit me, would I have had kittens?^^And I just left him there, alone. But nobody believed me. The doctor said I was delirious. That I must have hit my head. And Shane's the absolute WORST!! He's determined to hate Triss. Even though he'd never leave me on purpose. He didn't know! I didn't even know! Yoba, like I would've gone into the caves if I'd known? Why won't anyone believe me?\"^^(There's some very angry crossing out here.) \"What am I supposed to do? Is he still alive? Does he even remember me?^^I found something, in those books I 'borrowed' from (some angry scribbling out) the wizard (yeh, like he wants anything to do with me).^ If I can find Triss again, there's a counterspell. It's totally corny. Real fairy tale nonsense: not QUITE as bad as True Love's Kiss (TM) (although that might work too) but it still involves love. And the help of the fairies. So something to attract their attention? A scent, perhaps? Maybe one of those stones made from their crushed bones? (or would that just piss them off??).^ And it'll only work at midnight because spells are dumb like that.^^It's all academic anyway, I can't turn him back if I can't find him, and what am I going to do? Adopt every ginger cat in the entire countryside? Then bring them back here and toss them in the pool and hope for the best??!^Cats have good homing instinct don't they? If he remembers who he was, maybe he'll come back to us. IF he remembers... pretty big if, if you ask me.",
