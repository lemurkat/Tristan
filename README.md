Almost a decade ago, Tristan and his girlfriend, Mona, entered the mines.
Only one returned.
Until now.

Tristan is not an easy character to unlock, to even qualify you must have:
- completed Jas's story arc in my Ranch Expansion
- befriended Mr Ginger (Jas's furry friend) up to 10 hearts.
- installed the East Scarpe location mod.

Then through a series of events, conversation topics, and hidden map clues, you can start the process.

He comes complete with four configurable variants (light, dark, auburn, and purple), dialogue, heart events, and possibly soon some unique items.
His schedule will also influence that of other characters, specifically on the weekend.
And there will be some rival heart stuff to come.

CURRENTLY INCLUDED:
- full ability to unlock Tristan (if above conditions met)
- 10-heart event
- several other events as Tristan adapts to being back in town
- conversational dialogue from various NPCs
- his house in East Scarpe
- marriage dialogue
- new 10-heart event for Mr Ginger

TO COME:
- 14-heart event
- special items
- more heart events
- improved marriage dialogue
- marriage schedule
- wedding sprites

Getting Tristan into your game does involve a significant "sacrifice". He designed to be uninstalled safely at any time, regardless of what stage you are up to in your relationship.
Currently in progress and thus may be buggy.
